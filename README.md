## Questions ORM

This repository holds a simple ORM for accessing a database containing information about Questions, Users, Replies, Liked Questions and Followed Questions.

The base class is named ModelBase and is located in the `modelbaseclass.rb` file. The other classes inherit from this base class and can be used to access different information from the SQL Lite database.
